Testing
=======

Setup
-----
First, set up a clean Ubuntu 18.04 LTS server VM. Update it by running:
  * `sudo apt-get update`
  * `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
  * `sudo apt-get autoremove`
  * `sudo reboot`

At this point, it's recommended to take a snapshot or checkpoint of the VM to make repeated testing easier.
